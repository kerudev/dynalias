# dynalias

`dynalias` is a POSIX compliant script designed to simplify alias management by
creating a new concept: `dynamic aliases`.

Traditional aliases get deleted after the shell session is over, but dynamic
aliases persist across sessions and can be updated at any time.

To achieve this, aliases are stored in files, which contain code that is
executed when the alias is called.

## Setup

First, install the project on your home directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kerudev/dynalias.git "~/.dynalias"
```

Then, paste the following on `~/.bashrc`:

```sh
alias dynalias="~/.dynalias/dynalias.sh"
# dynalias set  # uncomment to update aliases on every new session

# This should exist by default. If not, paste the whole thing
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

## How to use

`dynalias` uses two core directories:
- `~/.dynalias`: contains the project's scripts.
- `~/.config/dynalias`: contains the `text` and `func` directories, and the
  `output` file (generated by the `set` command).

To start using `dynalias`, run `dynalias init` to initialize the folder
structure inside `~/.config/dynalias`.

Then run `dynalias set <type> <name>` to create an alias (for more information,
run `dynalias help`).

### text

Simple aliases that don't accept arguments. An example of a `text` alias:
```sh
# text/add
git add .
```

After formatting, `text` aliases are stored as raw text:

```sh
# output
alias add='git add .'
```

After running `dynalias`, you can use:

```sh
$ add   # This executes 'git add .'
```

### func

Aliases that require arguments. An example of a `func` alias:

```sh
# func/commit
commit() {
    if [[ -z $1 ]]; then
        echo "Missing commit message"
        exit 1
    fi

    git commit -m "$1"
}

commit "$@"  # Use "$@" to spread all args
```

After formatting, `func` aliases are stored as a path to their file:

```sh
# output
alias commit='$DYNALIAS_CONF/func/commit'
```

After running `dynalias`, you can use:

```sh
$ commit "Initial commit"   # This executes 'git commit -m "Initial commit"'
```

If you forgot the commit message:

```sh
$ commit
$ Provide a commit message
```
